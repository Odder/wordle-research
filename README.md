# Wordle Solver
Just a small project I use to tinker around with for finding the best possible humanly applicable strategy.

The goal is 
not to be able to solve the possible optimally assuming you are a computer, but rather figuring out how to reduce your 
average score assuming you are a human who can't store infinite amount of information.

Currently some decent starting word pairs found are:

| word1  | word2 |
|---|---|
| spilt | crane |
| price | slant |
| cried | slant |
| clasp | tried |
